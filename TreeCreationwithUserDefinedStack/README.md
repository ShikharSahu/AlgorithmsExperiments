## Read the javaImplementation for better understanding

## below is c++ implementation details

Comparison.cpp shows the difference between the time complexity of user defined stack and recursion while creating a binary tree.

getNumber function get a random number and the number may be -1, depending on the chance_of_end;
chance_of_end is the chance in 10, of getting -1 or a normal number.

treeCreationRandomly creates a random tree to get the inputs that made this tree and supply them to the other tree building algorithms. This algorithm as it generates random numbers is not timed.

The other algorithms are timed and they give adequate results.
